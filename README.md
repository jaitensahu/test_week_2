Here I have used the two iframe tags to divide the screen into two parts and to display other web pages within these two frames
in the left frame, we have a webpage embedded in it which consists of links of different webpages which will open on the right side of the screen when any link is clicked on

here I have used image tag <img > nested in anchor tag <a> to add a hyperlink to the image and used an attribute of "a" tag that is src which specifies the URL we want to open when 
the link gets clicked. 
Also used name and target attribute. The target attribute specifies the name that indicates where to open the webpage when any response is received.
